            To preach the message of the cross, the Gospel. It is the good news
            for sinners that Jesus Christ has come into this world to provide
            forgiveness for their sins to those who repent & believe in Him and
            to give them eternal life. The provision of forgiveness was made
            possible through the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ
            2000 years ago.
            <br />
            <br />
            The believers are saved from the wrath of God which is reserved for
            those whose sins are not forgiven and those who do not believe in
            His Son Jesus Christ.
            <br />
            <br />
            God gives eternal life to those who believe in His son Jesus Christ
            who Himself declared in John 14:6 “I am the way, the truth, and the
            life. No one comes to the Father except through Me”.
